             <p id = "about">  Promoting optimal urban land use is critical to help neighborhoods thrive and make cities sustainable.  While market forces encourage the most economic use of land, zoning serves as a check to assure the community is best served. Rezoning may be undertaken to create economic development, accommodate population growth, or respond to neighborhood needs and preferences. This study aims to determine what has caused results to deviate from intended goals in past rezonings to better anticipate and mitigate deviations in future rezonings. </p>
             <p>The project’s theoretical value is to understand how various land uses (e.g., residential, commercial) complement and compete with one another. The social value reflects the rezoned community’s needs.  Data was collected based on interviews with residential and commercial real estate developers who explained what drives the economics of developing an urban parcel, and includes demographic, land use, and neighborhood quality data. The data was loaded into a supervised machine learning model in which the dependent variable was land use. In addition, a second model was developed to predict future built floor area ratio (FAR) by land use. We developed a visualization tool which could be used to understand current trends and anticipate future needs of neighborhoods.</p>
            
             <h3 id = "problem"> Problem Statement and Scope </h3>
             <hr>

             <h4>Problem Definition</h4>
             <h4>The intentions behind rezoning do not always align with the resultant rezoned environment.</h4>
             <p>What is causing the disconnect between the stated goals and the actual outcomes of New York City rezonings? Why did the Downtown Brooklyn rezoning, intended to create a commercial district, become a mainly residential neighborhood, and why were the resultant residential problems such as school overcrowding not mitigated along the way?</p>
             <p>This problem occurs in rezonings because goals are decided in a one-time process that is not re-evaluated over time.  Moreover, planners are not held accountable to meet the goals and do not have an incentive to monitor the results over the course of the build.  As a result, unfavorable deviations are not properly mitigated.  Zoning provides incentives to developers through tradeoffs such as increased height restrictions and tax breaks in return for community benefits such as affordable housing or schools.  However, outside influences such as economic, technological, and cultural changes can upend the goals of a rezoning during and after the build years.  We identified the leading causes of the problem (“5 Whys”), and studied other cities’ experiences with rezoning. (See Appendix 2.)</p>
             
             <h4>Hypothesis: Quantifiable Problem</h4>
             <p>We merged data from different sources and years. Some patterns emerged, which informed our hypothesis and which metrics to examine. As shown in Figure 1, the rezoning changes to floor area ratios (FARs) and allowance for lot mergers in Downtown Brooklyn created incentives to erect taller buildings, resulting in builders’ maximizing available development rights.</p>
             <p>We expected that the extensive building was due in part to the more generous FARs allowed by the rezoning. However, that much of the mixed use FARs intended to develop commercial space were ultimately used for residential may also be due to external factors.  Our hypotheses included the following:  1) NYC’s high corporate tax rates created incentives for businesses to leave the city.  2) Housing prices at the time of the rezoning were lower in Brooklyn than in Manhattan, increasing residential demand in the rezoned area. 3) Amenities that attract commercial usage (such as open space and multiple transit options) likely also attracted residential customers to this area.</p>
             
             <h4>Problem Question</h4>
             <h4>How do we learn from a prior rezoning after it was built and did not meet its intended goals to improve the results of future rezoning?</h4>
             <p>We researched the details behind the NYC rezoning process, as well as the process to modify a zoning plan after approval (included in Appendix 3, ULURP Process). We interviewed a Downtown Brooklyn Community Board member to understand the Board’s vetting process for rezonings. Finally, we interviewed three real estate developers to learn what factors they consider when choosing whether to build on a particular lot. These factors became the variables in our model. </p>

            <p>The predicted factor is the lot land use. We ran different classification models (multinomial logistic regression, Random Forest, ensemble methods) to see whether the underlying trends would give us enough predictable power to identify a possible land use or to assign a certain probability to a specific event.</p>
